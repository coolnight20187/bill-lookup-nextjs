# Project Summary
The project is a modernized Bill Lookup System designed to improve the management of employee and customer data while streamlining billing transactions. Utilizing Supabase as the backend, it offers robust security through role-based access control and integrates functionalities such as real-time capabilities, audit trails, and user management. The system aims to provide businesses with an efficient and secure solution for their billing processes.

# Project Module Description
- **Database Schema (supabase_schema.sql)**: Defines the database structure, including tables for employees, members, warehouse, transaction history, work notes, audit logs, and system settings.
- **Row Level Security Policies (supabase_rls_policies.sql)**: Implements security policies to control data access based on user roles.
- **Authentication Setup (supabase_auth_setup.sql)**: Configures user authentication, including role management and JWT token customization.
- **Dashboard Management**: Provides a user interface for managing employees, customers, and inventory with role-based access control and responsive design.
